Feature: User marks a listing as sold

As a User of the Textbook Exchange System
I want to mark my listings as sold
So that I can indicate which books are no longer available for purchase

Background:
Given a user with email "test@example.com" and username "testuser" is logged into the system
And the following listings exist:
  | bookName        | ISBN                 | bookCondition | listingStatus | price   | datePosted  | course   |
  | mybook          | 999-9-9-9999999-0    | New           | Available     | 18.09   | 2025-02-01  | ECSE 428 |
  | mybook2         | 888-8-8-8888888-0    | Used          | Available     | 209.66  | 2025-01-23  | ECSE 429 |


Scenario: User marks their listing as sold (Normal Flow)

When the user "testuser" marks the listing with ISBN "999-9-9-9999999-0" as sold
Then the listing should be updated with:
  | bookName | ISBN              | listingStatus |
  | mybook   | 999-9-9-9999999-0 | Unavailable         |


Scenario: User tries to mark a listing as sold that has already been marked as sold (Error Flow)

Given the listing with ISBN "999-9-9-9999999-0" is already marked as "Sold"
When the user "testuser" attempts to mark the listing with ISBN "999-9-9-9999999-0" as sold again
Then the system should display an error message1 "This listing is already sold"


Scenario: User tries to mark another userâ€™s listing as sold (Access Control)

When the user "testuser" attempts to mark the listing with ISBN "092-5-2-1111111-9" as sold
Then the system should display an error message1 "You are not authorized to mark this listing as sold"

When the user "testuser" attempts to mark the listing with ISBN "999-9-9-9999999-0" as sold
Then the system should display an error message1 "An error occurred while updating the listing. Please try again later."
And the listing status should remain unchanged


Scenario: Admin overrides the status of a listing (Admin Privilege)

Given an administrator is logged into the system
When the administrator marks the listing with ISBN "999-9-9-9999999-0" as sold
Then the listing should be updated with:
  | bookName | ISBN              | listingStatus |
  | mybook   | 999-9-9-9999999-0 | Unavailable         |
